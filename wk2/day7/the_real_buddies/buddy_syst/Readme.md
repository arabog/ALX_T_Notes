# Buddy System
**buddy: a working companion with whom close cooperation is required.**  
The buddy system is an opportunity for you to grow and develop your network. It’s a chance to form a close-knit circle of deep friendships that works as a support system and motivation for you as you navigate the program.  

## Who is a buddy?
A buddy is a friend, someone to talk to, and most importantly, a study partner. We understand the complexities of this program and highly recommend each one of our Software Engineers should have one or more buddies.  
They are long term peers to hold PLD’s and discuss everything software engineering.  

## How do I connect to a buddy?
It’s hard talking to strangers or people you haven’t actually met. we totally get it. The good news is that you are not reaching out to strangers but to fellow software engineers, going through the program and its magnitude as you are  

Below is a step by step guide of how to get a buddy and connect to one.  
Access our virtual mentor on the team @Jasper  
Goto the home screen and click “Join a buddy group.”  
You will have to decide - are you joining a group of friends, or a group of peers you do not yet know.  
When you and 4 of your peers have joined the group, we will create a slack channel for you and invite you and Jasper to the channel.  

Once the group has been created, it is very important to do a proper introduction. Set up team huddles, and engage in the discussions, support each other on the curriculum and the projects you are working on. Remember,
**“Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.”**  

## Schedule
A schedule is one of the few ways of keeping each other accountable. Create a schedule together and set goals. You could start the Monday with a check-in and a Friday with a check-out. In addition to the projects - we could help each other by looking at and setting goals for our daily rhythm, mental health, food and diet, exercise and many more. To live a healthy, balanced and coherent life is conducive to your learning experience.  

## Stand-up
Pick a moment during the day, preferable at the start of the day, join a huddle, get of your chair (yes literally) stand-up and discuss and align the goals. Stand-ups do not have to take long - it might be 5 to 15 minutes where each member shares about the previous day and the goals for today, and what are the stumbling blocks. 

## Group lead
It could be an option to appoint a group lead to lead the stand-ups and attaining the goals for the week, and whatever your group decides would be important - to give all members this chance, you could decide to rotate this weekly.  
 
**Remember taking initiative is a form of self-empowerment. Don’t wait for someone to reach out to you, Reach out first**  

 Jasper connects Slack with the Intranet and allows you to join the buddy groups which are private groups on slack  

## What is the purpose of buddy groups?
Buddies are your accountability partners and those that keep you company while you walk this journey - each of you is a partner in someone else’s learning journey! Be sure of:  
Keeping pace with the to-dos of the week as the program goes on  
Share your projects for review, as well as other insights on the program  
Study and carry out other program-related activities together  

## What buddy groups are NOT for?
Doing your work for you. You are expected to carry your own weight and be an active participant in all projects. Attempt all projects/tasks by yourself first before reaching out for help. Respect everyones time.  


## Buddy system
The buddy system is basically working together in pairs in a large group or alone. Both the individuals have to do the job. The job could be to ensure that the work is finished safely or the skill/learning is transferred effectively from one individual to the other.  

## Stand-up meeting
A stand-up meeting is a meeting in which attendees typically participate while standing. The discomfort of standing for long periods is intended to keep the meetings short.  

Some software development methodologies envision daily team meetings to make commitments to team members. The daily commitments allow participants to know about potential challenges as well as to coordinate efforts to resolve difficult or time-consuming issues. The stand-up has particular value in agile software development processes, such as scrum or Kanban, but can be utilized in context of any software-development methodology.

The meetings are usually timeboxed to between 5 and 15 minutes, and take place with participants standing up to remind people to keep the meeting short and to-the-point. The stand-up meeting is sometimes also referred to as the "stand-up" when doing extreme programming, "morning rollcall" or "daily scrum" when following the scrum framework.

The meeting should usually take place at the same time and place every working day. All team members are encouraged to attend, but the meetings are not postponed if some of the team members are not present. One of the crucial features is that the meeting is a communication opportunity among team members and not a status update to management or stakeholders.

The older Scrum Guide (2017) suggested team members briefly (a maximum of one minute per team member) address three questions as input to this planning:  
What did I do yesterday that helped the development team meet the sprint goal?  
What will I do today to help the development team meet the sprint goal?  
Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the development team from meeting the sprint goal?
