# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
what steps do i need to learn how to learn?  
What is the Feynman learning technique and how can I implement it?  
What does it mean to own my own learning journey?  
In what ways can I crack through if I don’t get it***:)“  

## Which of the following is true about the Feynman learning technique (Select all that apply)
Because learning doesn’t happen from skimming through a book or remembering enough to pass a test  
Information is learned when you can explain it and use it in a wide variety of situations.  
Ultimately, the point of learning is to understand the world"  

## According to Richard Faynmen, what does it mean to know:
The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks  
When you only know what something is called, you have no real sense of what it is.  
When you know something, the labels are unimportant, because it’s not necessary to keep it in the box it came in.“  

## “which of the following is part of the recommended learning framework within the ALX program. (Select all that apply)
Read the project prerequisites, man pages, documentation, books, and articles. Try all the examples in the docs  
Pause, take a breath, and think of the solution. Make sure you understand all of the required concepts and algorithms before you proceed to solve tasks.  
Write or draw out your problem on a whiteboard or paper. It’s easier to visualize your problem when it isn’t pure code.  
Whether or not your code runs when you input it, make sure you know why it doesn’t (or does) work without looking at the error message.  

## If you still can’t find the solution or understand why your code doesn’t work, google it. Which of the following facts should be considered when googling (Select all that apply)
Only google something specific  
Never copy and paste something from the Internet. You need to understand everything before you implement something you read. Typing yourself - instead of cp/paste - ensures that you better understand and not miss any details.  

## When Asking a peer for help, it is important to remember… (Select all that apply)
it’s your job to ask and it’s your job to help  
Respect other people’s time  
Explain what the problem is and what you’ve tried"  

## “When giving help to a peer, it is important to… (Select all that apply)”
Respect every question; there is nothing more demotivating than having someone laughing at your question or being asked “what? you still don’t know that?”  
Do NOT give the final answer. You are here to guide, help them find the solution by themselves.  
There are no stupid questions  

## Which of the following completely describes the difference between focussed thinking and diffused thinking
focussed thinking is like seeing a brick wall and saying it’s just too difficult to run through or climb through while diffused thinking is like your mind saying “"Hey why don’t we tie balloons and just float over it  

## Which is more important: focused vs. diffuse thinking?
Both are required in order to master a topic or make progress on a difficult project. When you are learning something new, you need to understand both the context for the information (diffuse) and the specifics of the subject (focused).  

## Why you should ask and answer technical questions?
You learn how to ask questions  
You will gain a better understanding of the problem  
You learn by answering questions  

## How do you ask good technical questions?
Sum up your question in a title 
Provide context  
Provide code sample  
**Don't send/provide screenshots**  
Share what you’ve already tried  
Format, Lint, and Document Your Code
