## Focused vs. diffuse thinking: which is better for learning?
According to recent research on learning, there are two main ways that we process information: focused or diffuse thinking  

There are two approaches recommended by learning experts, the first being to push through the distraction and give your full concentration to a subject, and the second, to actually embrace the distraction.  

## Optimal thinking patterns for optimal learning
Our brains use two modes to process information: focused and diffuse thinking. One isn't better than the other; they're just different and undertstanding them can give you a pathway back to becoming productive again when you feel stuck in a rut.   

### What is focused thought?
Focused thinking is a highly attentive state of mind where the brain uses its best concentration abilities in the prefrontal cortex to ignore all extraneous information. And because of this, it's the preferred method for studying (and memorizing) knowledge-intensive subjects.  

When we are in our focused mode of thinking, it’s like we have a one-track mind for the matter at hand. It allows us to zoom directly in on the most pertinent information.  

### What is diffuse thought?
Diffuse thinking, on the other hand, doesn't zoom in on one particular thing. Rather, it looks at the "big picture". Diffuse thinking happens when you let your mind wander freely, making those random connections that are essential for creativity. Now, this isn't restricted to any particular region of the brain, but rather happens all over. In fact, that's the beauty of diffuse thinking: your brain has the opportunity to consider all information (and therefore connect the dots) outside of that limited, hyper-focused view.

Usually, we employ diffuse thinking when we do non-work tasks like taking a shower or going for a run. But—and here's the interesting thing—while focussed thinking is most often employed when we work or study, **our greatest creativity and problem-solving happen when we are thinking diffusely!**  

This is why taking a break from studying or "sleeping on it" can actually lead to important breakthroughs. While your conscious mind is relaxed, your brain is able to form a creative solution to a problem or finally link ideas that have been eluding you.  

Both types of thinking can be used to train the brain on a topic; they simply do so differently. To illustrate this point, consider a flashlight. You can have a concentrated beam of light that only illuminates a small area very brightly or you can have a less concentrated beam that illuminates a much broader area with more diffuse light.  

With focused thinking, your brain processes very specific information deeply; with diffuse thinking, the brain analyzes much more information at once but in less depth. Just like both flashlights will take you out of the dark, both modes of thinking will help you understand a subject better. Which one will work better for you simply depends on whether you want to see the big picture or the small details.  

**Spaced repetition is also a fundamental principle for more efficient learning**  

## Which is more important: focused vs. diffuse thinking?
Which mode of thinking is better for learning: focused vs. diffuse thinking? As it turns out, neither is better than the other; they're just different.  

While these two modes of thinking appear to work in opposition to each other, both are required to master a topic or make progress on a difficult project. After all, when you are learning something new, you need to understand both the context for the information (diffuse) and the specifics of the subject (focused).  

What this means is that alternating between focused and diffuse thinking is the best way to master a subject or solve a difficult problem. First, we use the focused mode of thinking to understand the basics of a topic without any distractions. Then we use the diffuse mode to passively internalize what we have learned and make connections to other things we already knew. Afterward, we go back into focused mode and pare down the connections that we made to the best, most helpful ones.  

Once you have repeated this process a few times, you'll find the information really stick in your memory!  

In fact, too much focus really can be a bad thing when it comes to problem-solving. The longer we keep our brains in focused mode, the more we experience tunnel vision, and outside-the-box thinking becomes impossible.  

When you’re feeling stuck or frustrated with a topic, it’s best to step back and take a break to let the diffuse mode run for a while. Too much diffuse thinking, on the other hand, will prevent you from truly understanding and memorizing the details.  

Our brain has two modes for good reasons: we need them both in order to really understand and process information and file it away in our memories. So, take advantage of them both when you’re learning to see better results. And if nothing else, you finally have a scientific excuse to take that nap you want!
