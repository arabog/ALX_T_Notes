# Your Learning Community

In ALX Community Code of Conduct we call out 3 reasons that ALX has put such emphasis on community these are:   
 * The Network   
 * The Empowered Journey   
 * Accountability    

 ## 1.The Network:
Build a strong network beyond the program: By enrolling you in a program offered by ALX, we are inviting you to join our family of learners, and we expect you to behave accordingly. The learner community is a space for you to get to know new people, engage with them and learn with them. We want this community to be an asset for you even after the program concludes.  

## 2. The Empowered Journey:
Community empowers you to lead your learning journey. You can learn almost anything online and at your own pace. We want to facilitate that transition and empower you to own your learning.  

## 3. Accountability
In the community, we hold each other accountable: Solo online learning can be intimidating,extremely hard to sustain without a proper support system. We aim to create an accountability system where learners can share resources, regularly support each other, can reach out for help, and provide feedback to one another. You never need to feel alone in your learning journey.
