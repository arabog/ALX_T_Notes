## Debugging
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging

In computer programming and software development, debugging(programming error) is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems.  

Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling. Many programming languages and software development tools also offer programs to aid in debugging, known as debuggers.   

Debuggers are software tools which enable the programmer to monitor the execution of a program, stop it, restart it, set breakpoints, and change values in memory. The term debugger can also refer to the person who is doing the debugging.
