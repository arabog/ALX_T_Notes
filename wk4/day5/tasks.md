# Tasks
## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do.  
The output of the program should be:  
The number, followed by  
if the number is greater than 0: is positive  
if the number is 0: is zero  
if the number is less than 0: is negative  
followed by a new line  
```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
/* more headers goes there */
#include <stdio.h>
/* betty style doc for function main goes there */
int main(void){
	int n;

	srand(time(0));
	n = rand() - RAND_MAX / 2;

	/* your code goes there */
    if (n > 0) {
        printf("%d is positive\n", n);
    }else if (n == 0) {
        printf("%d is zero\n", n);
    }else {
        printf("%d is negative\n", n);
    }
	
    return (0);
}
```
rand, rand_r, srand - pseudo-random number generator.  
The rand() function returns a pseudo-random integer in the  range
0   to   RAND_MAX   inclusive   (i.e.,   the  mathematical  range
[0, RAND_MAX]).  

The srand() function sets its argument as the seed for a new  sequence of pseudo-random integers to be returned by rand().  These sequences are repeatable by calling srand() with  the  same  seed
value.  

If  no  seed  value is provided, the rand() function is automatically seeded with a value of 1.  

printf - format and print data  
Print  ARGUMENT(s)  according  to FORMAT, or execute according to OPTION.  

## 1. The last digit
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program  
You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code  
The output of the program should be:  
The string Last digit of, followed by n, followed by the string is, followed by  
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5  
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0  
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line  
```

/**
 * main - Determines if a number is positive, negative or zero.
 *
 * Return: Always 0 (Success)
*/

int main(void) 
    int n, digit;

    srand(time(0));
    n = rand() - RAND_MAX / 2;

    /* your code goes there */
    digit = n % 10;

    if (digit > 5){
        printf("Last digit of %d is %d and is greater than 5\n", n, digit);
    }else if (digit == 0){
        printf("Last digit of %d is %d and is 0\n", n, digit);
    }else if (digit < 6 || digit != 0){
        printf("Last digit of %d is %d and is less than 6 and not 0\n", n, digit);
    }

    return (0);
}
```

## 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.  
You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)  
All your code should be in the main function  
You can only use putchar twice in your code  
```
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - Prints the alphabet.
 *
 * Return: Always 0 (Success)
 */
int main(void){       
    char xter[26] = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < 26; i++){       
        putchar(xter[i]);
    }

    putchar('\n');

    return (0);
}
```
fputc,  fputs,  putc,  putchar,  puts  - output of characters and strings.  
fputc() writes the character c, cast to an unsigned char, to stream.  
fputs()  writes  the  string s to stream, without its terminating null byte ('\0').  
putc() is equivalent to fputc() except that it may be implemented as a macro which evaluates stream more than once.  
putchar(c) is equivalent to putc(c, stdout).  
puts() writes the string s and a trailing newline to stdout.  

## 3. alphABET
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use putchar three times in your code   
```

 * Return: Always 0 (Success)
 */
int main(void){
    char xter[52] = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < 52; i++){
        putchar(xter[i]);
    }

    return (0);
