## 0. Hello World
Write a script that prints “Hello, World”, followed by a new line to the standard output.  
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World"

what do u think of this?
echo -e "Hello, \n World"
```
echo - display a line of text  
-e  enable d interpretatn of backslash escapes

## 1. Confused smiley
Write a script that displays a confused smiley "(Ôo)'.  
```

i.e  echo "\  {what to display} "  
```

## 2. Let's display a file

```
less - opposite of more  
To edit the file being viewed, press v, ds will initiate a text editor
u can dn use ctrl s, ctrl x to save and exit


## 3. What about 2?

tail -n10 /etc/passwd  
```
tail - output the last part of files  
Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.    
With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name?.  
```
tail -v 10 filename(s)
```

## 5. I'd prefer the first ones actually
Display the first 10 lines of /etc/passwd  
```
head -n 10 /etc/passwd
```
head - output the first part of files    
-v, --verbose: always print headers giving file names. like print a file name.  

## 6. Line ##2
Write a script that displays the third line of the file iacta.  
You’re not allowed to use `sed`  
```
head -n 3 my_file | tail -n 1

sed '1,4d' file.txt | tail -n 1
4d means to d 4th line but 4th line not inclusive
```
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sed-command-in-linux-unix-with-examples/  
sed(Sream  EDitor  for filtering and transforming text  
Though most common use of SED command in UNIX is for substitution or to find and replace. By using SED you can edit files even without opening them, which is much quicker way to find and replace something in file, than first opening that file in VI Editor and then changing it.  

**Replacing or substituting string:**  
Sed command is mostly used to replace the text in a file. The below simple sed command replaces the word “unix” with “linux” in the file.
```
$sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
```
Here the “s” specifies the substitution operation. The “/” are delimiters. The “unix” is the search pattern and the “linux” is the replacement string.  

By default, the sed command replaces the first occurrence of the pattern in each line and it won’t replace the second, third…occurrence in the line.  

**Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line:**    
Use the /1, /2 etc flags to replace the first, second occurrence of a pattern in a line. The below command replaces the second occurrence of the word “unix” with “linux” in a line.
```
$sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt
```
**Replacing all the occurrence of the pattern in a line:**  
The substitute flag /g (global replacement) specifies the sed command to replace all the occurrences of the string in the line.
```
$sed 's/unix/linux/g' geekfile.txt
```
**Replacing from nth occurrence to all occurrences in a line:**  
Use the combination of /1, /2 etc and /g to replace all the patterns from the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line. The following sed command replaces the third, fourth, fifth… “unix” word with “linux” word in a line.
```
$sed 's/unix/linux/3g' geekfile.txt
```
**Replacing string on a specific line number:**  
You can restrict the sed command to replace the string on a specific line number. An example is
```
$sed '3 s/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
```

**Duplicating the replaced line with /p flag:**  
The /p print flag prints the replaced line twice on the terminal. If a line does not have the search pattern and is not replaced, then the /p prints that line only once.
```
$sed 's/unix/linux/p' geekfile.txt
```
**Printing only the replaced lines:**  
Use the -n option along with the /p print flag to display only the replaced lines. Here the -n option suppresses the duplicate rows generated by the /p flag and prints the replaced lines only one time.
```
$sed -n 's/unix/linux/p' geekfile.txt
```

## 7. It is a good file that cuts iron without making a noise
Write a shell script that creates a file named exactly `\*\\'"Best School"\'\\*$\?\*\*\*\*\*:)` containing the text Best School ending by a new line. 
``` 
echo "Best School" > "\*\\\'\"Best School\"\'\\\*$\?\*\*\*\*\*:)"

        \*\\'"Best School"\'\\*$\?\*\*\*\*\*:)
i.e "   \*1\\'2"Best School3"\'4\\*$\?\*\*\*\*\*:)    "
d positions where esc xters r used r numbered. dse area consist of:
1. \\
2. "
3. "
4. \\
```
## 8. Save current state of directory
Write a script that writes into the file ls_cwd_content the result of the command ls -la. If the file ls_cwd_content already exists, it should be overwritten. If the file ls_cwd_content does not exist, create it.
```
ls -la > ls_cwd_content
```
ls -la List  information  about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuv SUX nor --sort is specified.  
```
ls -lt  show a long list with last modification time

ls -d */ or ls -l | grep '^d'   show only d directory
ls -l | grep '^-'   show only d file
ls -i print d index number of each file
ls -m    separate each list/item with a comma

ls -n   --numeric-uid-gid   like -l, but list numeric user and group IDs
ls -N   --literal print entry names without quoting
ls -o   like -l, but do not list group information
ls -p   append slash(/) indicator to directories
ls -Q   enclose entry names in double quotes
ls -r, --reverse   reverse order while sorting
ls -R, --recursive  list subdirectories recursively
ls -s, --size   print  the  allocated  size  of  each  file, in blocks
ls -S     sort by file size, largest first
ls --sort=WORD  sort by WORD instead of name: none (-U), size (-S), time (-t), version (-v), extension (-X)
ls -t     sort by modification time, newest first
ls -x     list entries by lines instead of by columns
ls -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension
```

## 9. Duplicate last line
Write a script that duplicates the last line of the file iacta
```
tail -n1 iacta >> iacta
```

## 10. No more javascript
Write a script that deletes all the regular files (not the directories) with a .js extension that are present in the current directory and all its subfolders.
```
find -name  "*.js" -type f -delete

find /tmp -type f,d,l
Search  for  files, directories, and symbolic links in
the directory /tmp

find -name Because the leading directories are  removed, the file names 
considered for a match with -name will never include a slash, so 
`-name  a/b'  will  never  match  anything (you probably need to use 
-path instead).

find -empty File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.

find -path pattern The metacharacters do not treat  `/'  or  `.'  
specially; so, for example, find . -path "./sr*sc" will print 
an entry for a directory called `./src/misc' (if  one  exists).
This means that this command will never match anything: find bar 
-path /foo/bar/myfile

find -perm mode  File's  permission bits are exactly mode (octal
or symbolic) e.g find -perm 775

find -used n File  was last accessed n days after its status
was last changed. find -used 1

find -delete Delete files; true if removal succeeded. If [the removal failed, an error message is issued.]

find -ls list current file in ls -dils format on standard  output.

find -print  print the full file name on the standard output, followed by a newline.  

find -type  Supported. POSIX specifies `b', `c', `d', `l', `p',  `f' and `s'.
Furthermore,  GNU find allows multiple types to be specified at once in a  
comma-separated list.

find /sbin /usr/sbin -executable \! -readable -print
Search for files which are executable but not readable.

find . -perm 664
Search for files which have read and write  permission
for  their owner, and group, but which other users can
read but not write to.  Files which meet these  crite‐
ria  but  have other permissions bits set (for example
if someone can execute the file) will not be matched.
```
find - **search** for files in a directory hierarchy. find is used to search for file/directory  

## 11. Don't just count your directories, make your directories count
Write a script that counts the number of directories and sub-directories in the current directory.
The current and parent directories should not be taken into account
Hidden directories should be counted
```
find . -type d ! -path . -print | wc -l

“paths must precede expression” error message
$ find . -name *.c -print
```

`find . -name frcode.c locate.c word_io.c -print`  
That  command  is of course not going to work, because the -name predicate allows exactly only one pattern as argument.   Instead  of  doing  things  this  way, you should enclose the pattern in  quotes  or  escape  the wildcard,  thus  allowing find to use the pattern with the wildcard during the search for file name  matching instead of file names expanded by the parent shell:  
$ find . -name '*.c' -print  
$ find . -name \*.c -print  

## 12. What’s new
Create a script that displays the 10 newest files in the current directory.  
Requirements: One file per line  
Sorted from the newest to the oldest  
```
ls -1t | head -10
ls -t | head -10
ls-lt | head -n 10
```
ls -t sort by modification time, newest first

## 13. Being unique is better than being perfect
Create a script that takes a list of words as input and prints only words 
that appear exactly once.  
Input format: One line, one word  
Output format: One line, one word  
Words should be sorted  
```
sort filename | uniq -u

index.txt
hello
hello
Third line
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello

sort index.txt | uniq -u
Third line
```
sort - sort lines of text files. Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.

uniq - report or omit repeated lines. 
uniq -u, --unique only print unique lines

## 14. It must be in that file
Display lines containing the pattern “root” from the file /etc/passwd  

## 15. Count that word
Display the number of lines that contain the pattern “bin” in the file /etc/passwd  

## 16. What's next?
Display lines containing the pattern “root” and 3 lines after them in the file /etc/passwd.  

## 17. I hate bins
Display all the lines in the file /etc/passwd that do not contain the pattern “bin”.  

## 18. Letters only please
Display all lines of the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config starting with a letter.  

include capital letters as well  

## 19. A to Z
Replace all characters A and c from input to Z and e respectively.  

## 20. Without C, you would live in hiago
Create a script that removes all letters c and C from input.  

## 21. esreveR
Write a script that reverse its input.  

## 22. DJ Cut Killer
Write a script that displays all users and their home directories, sorted by users.  

Based on the the /etc/passwd file  

## 23. Empty casks make the most noise
Write a command that finds all empty files and directories in the current directory and all sub-directories.  

Only the names of the files and directories should be displayed (not the entire path)  
Hidden files should be listed  
One file name per line  
The listing should end with a new line  
You are not allowed to use basename, grep, egrep, fgrep or rgrep  

##  24. A gif is worth ten thousand words
Write a script that lists all the files with a .gif extension in the current directory and all its sub-directories.  

Hidden files should be listed  
Only regular files (not directories) should be listed  
The names of the files should be displayed without their extensions  
The files should be sorted by byte values, but case-insensitive (file aaa should be listed before file bbb, file .b should be listed before file a, and file Rona should be listed after file jay)  
One file name per line  
The listing should end with a new line  
You are not allowed to use basename, grep, egrep, fgrep or rgrep  

## 25. Acrostic
An acrostic is a poem (or other form of writing) in which the first letter (or syllable, or word) of each line (or paragraph, or other recurring feature in the text) spells out a word, message or the alphabet. The word comes from the French acrostiche from post-classical Latin acrostichis). As a form of constrained writing, an acrostic can be used as a mnemonic device to aid memory retrieval. Read more.  

Create a script that decodes acrostics that use the first letter of each line.  

The ‘decoded’ message has to end with a new line  
You are not allowed to use grep, egrep, fgrep or rgrep  

## 26. The biggest fan

Order by number of requests, most active host or IP at the top  
You are not allowed to use grep, egrep, fgrep or rgrep
