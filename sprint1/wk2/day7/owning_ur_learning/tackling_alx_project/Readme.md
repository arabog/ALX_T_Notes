Most people wonder how a school can function without a teacher, but I realized that a peer himself is the best teacher there can be. When two or more students come to learn together, it is the best masterclass experience that I have come to learn and embrace.  

**Doing the projects on time** to meet the deadlines is one thing, and **grasping the project’s concepts** is another. As a student, you have to be truthful to yourself and distinguish between the two.  

### Step 1
Open the day’s project and go through it real quick. See everything but do not respond to anything (even if you know the correct response)  

This step will help you identify the key concepts that you should learn on that day. You will also have a clue of the questions asked in the pre-projects quizzes.  

### Step 2
Go through the Concepts and Resources given in the project.
Keenly read through the referenced materials and take notes of every new concept learned. In some projects, both the Concepts and Resources sections will be available, while in some only the Resources section will be there. Read and understand everything. If there is something that you think you need more explanation on, write it somewhere in your notebook, you will research more about it later.  
```
It is a suitable behavior to always write brief notes of the concepts learnt and go through them on a later date. Learning and relearning helps to emphasize concepts in your brain to understand better.
```
### Step 3
Scan the General concepts that you should have understood. Mark the concepts that you are confident in and note on those that you feel you need more clarification.  

Make sure that you can respond to all the General questions well. Use The Feynman Learning Technique to perfect your understanding.   

### Step 4
Do the pre-project quiz  
I have a quick tip for you on how you can easily do the pre-project quizzes.

**1. Answer one question at a time, and press the check button.**  
**2. When you get the first question done, you can move on to the next questions one by one and repeat the same thing…**  

### Step 5
Confirm the project’s requirements  
Not all projects have requirements specifications. If the day’s project has it, follow the procedure well and set your system to the required standards.  

### Step 6.0
Start doing the project’s tasks by reading the first question.  
Understand what the question is asking of you. It will be better if you can locate which concept the question demands from you. If it is a coding question, go ahead and pseudo-code your response on pen and paper. Read the question again and go through your code several times to make sure that your code sufficiently replies to the question asked.   

Explaining things out loud is a way to reinforce your understanding of the same thing. Describing your code out loud will enable you to spot the semicolon that you mistakenly forgot to place (or any error).  

In case rubber-duck debugging cannot solve your issue as well, you can try to reach out to your first consultation office, which is your squad.   

Be concise on your problem. Mention the name of the project that you are stuck on, the question number, and the methods that you have previously used in your unsuccessful trials. Your squad will be there to help.  

In case your squad wasn’t able to help, go to your second consultation office, your tribe/cohort.   

PS: The process is simple  
read_question > understand > pseudocode > test_code > debug > run_checker  

## Step 7
Go through your project again. Ensure that all checks are running correctly.
Ensure that your project is marked 100% done  

## Step 8
Go over the slack channels  
This is not a mandatory part of the project, but I consider it suitable behaviour for a great learner. Finishing the day’s project means that you have understood the concepts and you are in a position to help other peers who need your help. However, helping them does not mean giving them direct correct answers to the projects, it means serving them with leads that will get them to the correct answers. Leads help learners to understand on their own while direct answers will just make the peer pass checker for that moment and never in the future. Always help with leads, not direct answers.  

Move through the slack channels and be there for those who need your help. See the challenges other peers faced and how they solved them. There is no harm to learn more and be hungry for more knowledge.  
A little motivation here and there won’t be bad either, encourage other peers to keep moving — it’s always a sweet feeling.  

## Step 9
Prepare for the next project. Read ahead following the week’s schedule. Be ready to do hard things.
