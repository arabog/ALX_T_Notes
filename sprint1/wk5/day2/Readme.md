## General
What are nested loops and how to use them  
What is a function and how do you use functions  
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function  
What is a prototype  
Scope of variables  
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89  
What are header files and how to to use them with #include  

## Requirements
You are not allowed to use global variables  
No more than 5 functions per file  
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar  
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples  
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h  
Don’t forget to push your header file
