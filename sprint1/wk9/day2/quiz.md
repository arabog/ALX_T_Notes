# Question #0
Which one is a pointer to a function?  
int (*func)(int a, float b);

# Question #1
To store the address of this function:
```
void neyo(void);
```
to the variable f of type pointer to a function that does not take any argument and does not return anything, you would do (check all correct answers if there is more than one):  
f = neyo;  

f = &neyo;

# Question #2
If f is a pointer to a function that takes no parameter and returns an int, you can call the function pointed by f this way (check all correct answers if there is more than one):  
f();  

(*f)();  

# Question #3
This void (*anjula[])(int, float) is:  
An array of pointers to functions that take an int and a float as parameters and returns nothing

# Question #4
What does a pointer to a function point to (check all correct answers if there is more than one)?  
code  

The first byte of code of the function
