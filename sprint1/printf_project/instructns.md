## format specifier
**check protection” characters**

The most natural way to print numbers seems to be right-justified with leading spaces. That is what %5d means: print a base-10 number in a field of width 5, with the number right-aligned and front-filled with spaces.
To make the number left-aligned, a minus sign is added to the format specifier. To print a number 5 spaces wide and left-justified (left-aligned) the format specifier is %-5d.
