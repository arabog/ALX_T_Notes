## Arrays
Arrays in C are contiguous memory areas that hold a number of values of the same type. Unlike some other languages, in C, all elements of an array have the same type. To declare an array we use this syntax: type var_name[number_of_elements];, where number_of_elements is the number of elements of type type that we need.
```
int t[5];  
```
In this example we declare an array of 5 integers. The computer will reserve a continuous space for 5 integers in memory.   
We access the different elements of an array this way: t[0] will access the first element, t[1] the second element, and so on.
