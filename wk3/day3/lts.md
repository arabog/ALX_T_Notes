# LTS - Long Term Support
We produce a new Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server release every six months. That means you'll always have the latest and greatest applications that the open source world has to offer. Ubuntu is designed with security in mind. You get free security updates for at least 9 months on the desktop and server.  

A new LTS version is released every two years. In previous releases, a Long Term Support (LTS) version had three years support on Ubuntu (Desktop) and five years on Ubuntu Server. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, both versions received five years support. There is no extra fee for the LTS version; we make our very best work available to everyone on the same free terms. Upgrades to new versions of Ubuntu are and always will be free of charge.  

## Release Plan Details
We start stabilising the release early by significantly limiting the number of new features. We will choose which features we package into the LTS release, versus which ones we leave out and allow for users to optionally download and use from a separate archive.  
Avoid structural changes as far as possible, such as changing the default set of applications, lots of library transitions, or system layer changes (example: introducing KMS or hal â†’ DeviceKit would not have been appropriate changes in a LTS).  

Furthermore, we define the LTS to be:  
Enterprise Focused: We are targeting server and multiple desktop installations, where the average user is moderately risk averse.  
Compatible with New Hardware: We will make point releases throughout the development cycle to provide functional support for new server and desktop hardware.  
More Tested: We will shorten the development window and extend the Beta cycle to allow for more testing and bug fixing.
